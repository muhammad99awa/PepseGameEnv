The trees package was implemented with the intention of
simulating tree objects within a game environment,
focusing on their structure, behavior, and interaction
with other game elements such as the avatar and the day-night cycle.
This implementation aims to enhance the game's visual appeal
and interactive dynamics.

1. Class Details within the trees Package
Tree: The central class that represents a complete tree,
including its trunk, leaves, and fruits. It serves as a
composite object that combines these elements into a cohesive unit.
TreeTrunk: Represents the trunk of the tree.
It's designed to be a static, immovable object with physical
properties to prevent intersection with other objects,
thereby simulating a solid trunk.
TreeLeaves: A collection of Leaf objects that represent the
leaves of the tree. This class manages the creation and
behavior of leaves, including their visual representation and
reactions to environmental changes or interactions.
Leaf: Individual leaf objects that can change properties
such as color or rotation to simulate effects like wind
or interaction with the game's avatar.
Fruits: Similar to TreeLeaves, this class manages a
collection of Fruit objects, simulating fruits that can
be interacted with by the avatar for energy gains or other effects.
2. Relationships Between the Classes
Composition: The Tree class acts as a composite object that
holds instances of TreeTrunk, TreeLeaves, and Fruits.
This reflects a real-world analogy where a tree comprises these elements,
showcasing a clear compositional relationship.
Aggregation: TreeLeaves and Fruits aggregate multiple Leaf
and Fruit objects, respectively. They manage collections of these items,
allowing for collective behavior and properties
(e.g., rendering, interactions) to be applied.
Dependency: The Leaf and Fruit classes depend on the game's environment,
such as Vector2 for positioning and other game object properties for their rendering and behavior.
Additionally, Fruits and TreeLeaves depend on external factors
like GameObjectCollection for adding their elements to the game world.
3. Design Pattern Usage
In the implementation of the trees package, several
design principles and potentially a design pattern have been used:

Composite Pattern: Most evidently seen in the Tree class,
which acts as a composite of TreeTrunk, TreeLeaves,
and Fruits.
This pattern allows for treating individual and compositions of objects uniformly,
facilitating the management of tree elements as a single object or individually.
Iterator Pattern: Utilized in TreeLeaves and Fruits to provide a way to
access the elements of a collection (leaves or fruits) sequentially without
exposing the underlying representation. This pattern is directly supported
by implementing the Iterable<GameObject> interface.
While the composite and iterator patterns are the most prominent,
other principles of object-oriented design, such as encapsulation
and modularity, are also adhered to, ensuring a clear structure,
separation of concerns, and the ability to extend or modify
parts of the package with minimal impact on others.
